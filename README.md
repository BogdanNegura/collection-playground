## How to start?

1. Click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the project on your own profile.
1. Click the **Clone or download** button and copy the path to the project.
1. On your local machine, open your favourite command line and clone the project: ```git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/collection-playground.git```
1. Change into your project: ```cd collection-playground```
1. Install dependencies: ```npm i```
1. Open with Visual Studio Code (optional) or your favourite editor: ```code .```
1. Start your local server: ```npm start```
1. Create a new branch using your github username, like: ```git checkout -b yourGithubUsernameHere```. What I did was: ```git checkout -b marianzburlea```
1. In the `src` folder you want to create your own folder. Name it using your github username, like: ```yourGithubUsername```. I created a folder **marianzburlea** as _marianzburlea_ is the username I have on GitHub.
1. Replicate the structure of files and content you can find in ```src/codetapacademy``` and start working on implementing your own idea and own interface that feeds of the content of the file located at ```src/_data/sample.json```
1. Once you have at least one or more commits, feel free to make a push, like: ```git push -u origin yourGithubUsernameHere```. What I did was: ```git push -u origin marianzburlea```. Visit your repositiory on your own profile on **GitHub** where you should see a button in a yellow box where you can start to create a PR (Pull Request) to the original project. Feel free to ask for reviews from the Students of CodeTap Academy.
